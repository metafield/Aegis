svg -> didn't work -> issues like React keys
figure out basics first:

- basic loop
- most performant time system date vs now() vs using what was provided
- add vectors
- draw basic shapes
- get basic types
- work on architecture to draw and update objects
- basic user input and vectors
- better interfaces with the generic gameObject type
- using mutation correctly to get render times down
- providing draw, update and destroy a consistent Context that includes tools to interact with the game outside of itself (a better solution to DI than svelte's in this case)
